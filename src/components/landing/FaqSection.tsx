    question: "How does Trendsetter Pro adapt to Google's updates like the 'Muvera' algorithm?",
    answer: "This is at the core of our strategy. Updates like 'Muvera' emphasize rich, multi-modal content. Trendsetter Pro directly addresses this by not only creating E-E-A-T aligned articles but also by enabling you to convert that text into engaging videos with a single click. By helping you build a library of both text and video content, we ensure your strategy is aligned with the future of search."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Trendsetter Pro different from other AI writers?",
    answer: "Three things: 1) We focus on the entire content lifecycle, from trend discovery to performance analysis. 2) Our AI is trained to generate content aligned with Google's E-E-A-T guidelines for long-term SEO success. 3) Our core advantage is the 'Performance-Driven Content Loop'—the AI analyzes your content's results and gets smarter, providing recommendations to improve your strategy over time. This creates a competitive moat for your business."
  },
  {
    question: "How do the 'AI Agents' work?",
    answer: "Each 'agent' is a specialized AI model fine-tuned for a specific task (e.g., finding trends, analyzing articles). Our platform uses an 'agentic' approach, where we can chain these agents together. For example, the Trend Agent can find a topic, which is then passed to the Content Agent to write an article, creating a powerful, automated workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the generated content unique and SEO-friendly?",
    answer: "Yes. The content generated by our AI is unique and created based on your specific inputs. Our prompts are engineered to produce SEO-optimized content that aligns with Google's E-E-A-T guidelines, including proper use of HTML tags and metadata suggestions for popular SEO plugins like Yoast and AIOSEO."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Competitor Analyzer work?",
    answer: "You provide the URL of a competitor's article, and our agent crawls the page, analyzes the content, and generates a 'report card.' This report includes key topics, a content grade, a summary of the article's tone, and, most importantly, a list of 'content gaps'—related sub-topics the competitor missed that you can use to create a more comprehensive article."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I publish content to my WordPress site?",
    answer: "Our Content Creation hub features a one-click 'Publish' button. When configured, this sends the generated article, its title, metadata, and even the AI-generated featured image directly to your WordPress site as a new post draft via a secure webhook. You need to install our companion plugin on your WordPress site to enable this."
