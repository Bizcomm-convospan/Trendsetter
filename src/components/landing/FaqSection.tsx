    question: "What is Trendsetter Pro?",
    answer: "Trendsetter Pro is an all-in-one platform that provides a suite of specialized AI agents designed to automate and supercharge your content strategy, SEO, and sales prospecting workflows. It helps you discover trends, analyze competitors, generate high-quality content, and find new leads."
  },
  {
    question: "How do the 'AI Agents' work?",
    answer: "Each 'agent' is a specialized AI model fine-tuned for a specific task (e.g., finding trends, analyzing articles, extracting contact data). Our platform uses an 'agentic' approach, where we can chain these agents together. For example, the Trend Agent can find a topic, which is then passed to the Content Agent to write an article, creating a powerful, automated workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the generated content unique and SEO-friendly?",
    answer: "Yes. The content generated by our AI is unique and created based on your specific inputs. Our prompts are engineered to produce SEO-optimized content, including proper use of HTML tags (headings, lists, etc.) and metadata suggestions for popular SEO plugins like Yoast and AIOSEO."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for sales and lead generation?",
    answer: "Absolutely. The Autonomous Prospecting agent is specifically designed for this. You can provide a URL (like a company's 'About Us' or 'Team' page), and the agent will crawl it to extract company details, key personnel, roles, and publicly available contact information, saving it to your prospects list."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between the Basic and Pro plans?",
    answer: "The Basic plan is great for individuals and small teams, offering a generous amount of credits for each tool. The Pro plan provides unlimited access to most of our agents, a higher limit for article generation, and API access for custom integrations, making it ideal for professionals and businesses."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I publish content to my WordPress site?",
    answer: "Our Content Creation hub features a one-click 'Publish' button. When configured, this sends the generated article, its title, metadata, and even the AI-generated featured image directly to your WordPress site as a new post draft via a secure webhook. You need to install our companion plugin on your WordPress site to enable this."
