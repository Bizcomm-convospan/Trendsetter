            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
